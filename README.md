# PORM - Yet Another&trade; PHP ORM

**The goal of this fork is to push PORM to PHP 8.2 compatibility. Nothing more.** But I might add *some* documentation.

PORM exists for one reason and one reason only: I'm *very much* used to working with a high-level OO library
when programming sh*t, but recently I started working on a project which was backed by a Firebird database
and for reasons beyond me (or the scope of this document) the taskmaster refused to switch to something sensible.
But no decent ORM that I know of supports Firebird (and with good reason). So I ended up rolling my own.

Please do not expect any kind of support or documentation because I suck.
